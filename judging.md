#Judging
Judging is done on slack and solutions will be visible to anyone. You may continue to edit your solution until the end of the contest. Simply format your post to the #PCG channel in this format (Replace brackets with your values. Place your code inside the backticks.):

```
Solution For Hole: <hole number here>
Byte Count: <number of bytes here>
```your code here```
I pledge the UMW Honor Code ~<Firstname Lastname>
```

Please insure it is formatted verbatim as a program will be grading your solutions. Submissions must be a single slack message, it may be necessary to copy and paste from a separate document.

*The UMW Honor Code applies to all aspects of this competition.* If you do not include the pledge line your submission will not be counted.
