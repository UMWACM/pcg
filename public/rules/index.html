  		<p>The purpose of code golf is to create a program that solves a problem in the least amount of characters possible. A character counts as 1 byte and includes whitespace characters. The person with the smallest number of bytes wins.</p>
<p>Any programming language can be used but there is a strict ban on languages designed specifically for code golf. Chances are if you plan to use one of said languages you already know it was designed for code golf but if you are not sure contact me. APL is also not allowed as it uses unicode characters that count as two bytes each.</p>
<p>There are 18 &quot;Holes&quot; which are each a single challenge the person who earns the most points wins. Holes are rated by difficulty with the par number being the number of points you can score for winning that hole:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Par 2</em> Easy Peasy</li>
<li><em>Par 3</em> Okish</li>
<li><em>Par 4</em> Above Average</li>
<li><em>Par 5</em> Difficult</li>
<li><em>Par 6</em> Insane</li>
</ul>
<p>Higher difficulties score more points per hole.</p>
